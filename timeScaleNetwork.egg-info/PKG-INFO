# TimeScaleNetwork

Install the TimeScaleNetwork package using the pip command

pip3 install git+https://github.com/centerforimplantabledevices/timescalenetwork.git

Then you are ready to use the Time Scale Network! Keep in mind these best practices when using the Time Scale Network:

* It is best to keep channel and signal length dimensions to be a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...)
  If you have an uneven dimension length, pad with zeros.
